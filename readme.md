## Getting Started

### Clone repository to your local machine

1. Create a new folder or navigate to an existing one:

   ```bash
   mkdir <directory name>
   ```

```bash
cd <path>
```

2. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ABIsolution/homepage.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd homepage
   ```

4. Install project dependencies:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Start the Development Server

To run your Next.js TypeScript application in development mode, use the following command:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start your development server, and you can access your Next.js application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.
