## Prerequisites

# Node.js

**Node.js:** version 18.18.2.

You can download and install Node.js version 18.18.2 from [this link](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v18.18.2/).

**Windows**

1. Download the Windows Installer (MSI) package for Node.js version 18.18.2 from the provided link.

2. Run the downloaded MSI installer package. Follow the installation wizard's instructions, and make sure to add Node.js to your system's PATH during the installation process.

To check if Node.js is installed correctly, open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window and run the following commands:

```bash

node -v
```

It should display the installed Node.js version, which should be v18.18.2.

```bash

npm -v
```

    This should display the version of npm installed.

**Mac**

1. Download the macOS Installer (PKG) package for Node.js version 18.18.2 from the provided link.

2. Run the downloaded PKG installer package and follow the installation instructions.

To verify the Node.js installation, open a Terminal and run the following commands:

```bash

node -v
```

This should display the installed Node.js version, which should be v18.18.2.

```bash

npm -v
```

This should display the version of npm installed.

# Git

- **Git:** You'll also need Git for version control. If you don't have Git installed, you can download and install it from [the official Git website](https://git-scm.com/).

  To check if you have Git installed, run:

  ```bash
  git --version
  ```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ABIsolution/homepage.git
   ```

2. Install project dependencies:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server with the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start your Next.js application in development mode. You can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

4. You can now begin developing.
